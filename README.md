This project provides information about a custom implementation of the printf function developed by students Maryam Ben Aissa and Fatima Zohra Lakhal as part of our learning experience in cohort #14. The _printf() function mimics the behavior of the original printf function by sending formatted output to stdout. It accepts a format string and additional arguments specified using the '%' operator.

The authorized functions and macros used in the implementation include write, malloc, free, va_start, va_end, va_copy, and va_arg.

The compilation instructions for the code, specifying the required flags and warnings to be used during compilation.

Examples of using the _printf() function are provided, demonstrating how to print basic strings, integers, and other specifiers like binary, octal, hexadecimal, and pointer addresses. Flags and width modifiers are also mentioned, although some are marked as still being in development.

The lists of the files contained in the repository, including the main files, auxiliary files, and header files. Each file is briefly described.

The tasks required for the project are outlined, specifying the conversion specifiers and functionalities that need to be handled. These include handling different data types, flags, precision, width, and length modifiers. Custom conversion specifiers like printing reversed strings and ROT13 translation are also mentioned. by crediting the
